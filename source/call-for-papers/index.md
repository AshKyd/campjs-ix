CampJS call for papers is now open! We are looking for both talks and workshops! This year, CampJS runs from 10-13th August at Koonjewarre, QLD.

<a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfGGf4jZLf4SQNBljGxdxqtOZ7XR_sd4xFSoeZ8qpCJfMeY2A/viewform">Submit a talk/workshop</a>

Submissions close midnight 29th April 2018. You will hear back from us before 1st June.

# The (un)conference format

Out in the wilderness, CampJS is a very laid back atmosphere and is a great opportunity for first time speakers!

This time around we are having two main tracks:

<dl>
  <dt>Talks</dt>
  <dd>Featured speakers (this is you!) with time scheduled for unstructured lightning talks</dd>
  <dt>Workshops & non-tech activities</dt>
  <dd>Longer-form learning opportunities for beginners or advanced campers.</dd>
</dl>

Attendees will have the opportunity to choose between talks or workshops. Where possible we will align related talks and workshops so attendees can do both, and put speakers in touch with workshop organizers to collaborate when it makes sense.

## üó£ Submit a talk
We‚Äôre open to a wide range of topics relating to Javascript, web development, technology and the industry as a whole.

<dl>
  <dt>Language</dt>
  <dd>All talks are in English.</dd>
  <dt>Talk Duration</dt>
  <dd>Under 30 minutes. Questions at the end if time permits</dd>
</dl>

Successful talks in the past have included elements of:

* The latest developments in the Javascript world
* Introductions to new frameworks & ideas (ideally which campers can build on through the&nbsp;weekend)
* New browser technologies and how they work
* Making art with code (audio, video, games)
* Your experiences getting stuff done
* Server-side Javascript tech (NodeJS, serverless, the cloud)
* Reflection on the state of the industry
* How to improve yourself as a developer
* Virtual & augmented reality
* Hardware, robotics and Internet of Things
* Infosec & keeping your apps safe
* Anything else! This is your conference!

We want to hear from a range of voices, so if you‚Äôre on the fence as to whether your proposal is a good fit, please submit it anyway!

## üè´ Submit a workshop
Workshops at CampJS are an opportunity for attendees to learn a skill and walk away having been taught or built something.

Ideally workshops plant a seed that will grow over the weekend. This might be teaching a skill, setting up a competition, or encouraging attendees to continue hacking on something on their own through the weekend.

<dl>
  <dt>Duration</dt>
  <dd>Workshops are of variable length. In the past workshops have run from half an hour to the full day</dd>
  <dt>Format</dt>
  <dd>This is fairly open. You get a room with space to present, and space for attendees to make/hack/create a thing of their own.</dd>
</dl>

Some successful workshops in the past have involved:

1. Kite making with JS hardware
1. Wearable electronics
1. Guided adventures for beginners using [workshopper-adventure](https://github.com/workshopper/workshopper-adventure) or similar
1. Knitting and e-textiles (see [Kris's writeup](https://www.web-goddess.org/archive/15420))
1. NodeBoats remote controlled boats ([See the NodeBoats repo on GitHub](https://github.com/notthetup/nodeboats-material))

If you are running a workshop you are welcome to have your company sponsor the materials and be listed on the [sponsors](/sponsors/) page.

Workshops are a great way to get involved and teach a skill. If you‚Äôre on the fence as to whether your proposal is a good fit, please submit it anyway!

## Run a side-activity
We're always looking for people to run activities on the side.

If you have a hobby you want to bring to camp (think bushwalking, drone flying, knitting, music) let us know:

1. <a href="https://github.com/campjs/campjs-ix/issues/new">Create an issue</a> letting us know what your activity is
1. Let us know how much time you're willing to set aside for it on the weekend (a couple of hours, a full day etc) and we'll add it to the schedule
1. Don't forget to include some info about what your activity will be like, and what campers need to bring

Please note that side-activities are intended to be a bit of fun, so you'll still need to buy a ticket and get yourself to camp. If there are resources or materials required we may be able to help cover costs on a case-by-case basis.

# üí∏ What you get
If your talk or workshop is accepted at CampJS you get:

1. We cover your ticket to CampJS, which includes
1. Free meals through the weekend
1. Accommodation in our comfy dorms
1. The opportunity to hang out with a bunch of really awesome speakers and attendees, and make friends for life üòä

CampJS is a **volunteer run organisation** which tries to keep tickets as cheap as possible. This means we can't generally cover the cost of your transport. However we have a few options available:

* **Speaker sponsor**: If your employer pays your travel expenses, we will list them as a speaker sponsor and give them extra perks. When you're accepted we will provide you a sponsor pack to help convince your boss üëç
* If you can't get your organization onboard with the speaker sponsor package and you're in need financial assistance, we will do our best to cover your travel costs but we will need to consider this on a case-by-case basis.

We want you to be comfortable and have a great time, so if there's anything you need please get in touch with one of the organizers and we can work something out.

## How talks are chosen
This year we will have fewer talks and have a commitment to improving diversity in our speakers.

To achieve this our process for chosing speakers and workshops is as follows:

1. Submissions are received by the due date
1. Submissions are anonymised
1. Talks are reviewed, shortlisted, and voted on by our team of organisers based on the value added to the community (relevance, clarity, originality, whimsy)
1. Submissions are de-anonymised and the final schedule is chosen
1. Speakers are notified at this time (regardless of the outcome)

We're very keen to help speakers out as part of this process. If you want feedback on your submission, please let us know and we will get back to you with any critique and feedback.

# Code of conduct

By applying to speak you agree to follow the conference [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct). We are committed to providing a harassment-free, professional and welcoming environment for all attendees.

Speakers should pay particular attention and avoid using visuals, audio or language that may potentially be considered offensive or harmful.

Please ensure you understand the [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct) before submitting your proposal.
