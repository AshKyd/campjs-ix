title: Diversity & Inclusiveness
---
We value the diversity and inclusion of under-represented and marginalized people in tech.

CampJS is a friendly and welcoming environment and <a href="/code-of-conduct">does not tolerate discrimination or harrassment of any kind</a>.

You can [see the range of initiatives we're working on, and suggest others](https://github.com/campjs/campjs-ix/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22diversity+%26+inclusiveness%22) on the Github issue tracker for the latest camp.
