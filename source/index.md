Networking with other developers is arguably the most valuable aspect of a conference, yet itâ€™s often a fleeting affair that happens in-between a conference schedule. But CampJS isnâ€™t a regular conference. This weekend-long retreat allows everyone enough time to learn new things, relax and most importantly: create real friendships and connections.

CampJS creates a unique blend of expert-led, structured content and self-directed, unstructured learning. Some content is scheduled, but the main area is reserved for hacking. The final night is reserved for demos for people to show off what they have built or learned at the event

<h2>ðŸ¤” <a href="/the-camp/">How does it work</a></h2>

Campers arrive on the Friday, find a bunk, and set up laptops & equipment in the main hall.

Womens, mens, couples and family dorm-style accommodation is provided, but more adventurous campers can bring a tent and rough it on the grounds of Koonjewarre.

Food and drink are included in the price, as well as <a href='/the-camp/accommodation'>comfortable accommodation</a> for the three nights of the event.

## ðŸ™‹ Join us!
CampJS is committed to <a href="/diversity-inclusiveness">diversity &amp; inclusiveness</a>. Whether you're a Javascript veteran, total newbie, or even more into art, music or hardware, there's something for everyone at CampJS.

The official camp schedule includes tech talks and Javascript workshops, but attendees also run other activities like bushwalking, drone flying, and even knitting. If you have an idea and want to run a side-event, <a href="/organisers">let us know!</a>
