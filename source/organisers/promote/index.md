You know CampJS is awesome, I know CampJS is awesome. Let's spread the word so
everyone knows how great CampJS is!

One of the things we're trying to do this time around is [reaching out to a wider
range of communities to promote the CFP and tickets](https://medium.com/@campjs/ash-writes-on-being-a-campjs-organizer-78aa92ba21e4),
with the goal of making CampJS a more diverse and welcoming place for everyone.

## Promoting the CFP
The first thing we need to do is get the CFP out as widely as possible.

We've tied the opening in to Global Diversity CFP Day and are stoked to see
talks from newbie speakers start to hit the meetups! But this isn't a set and
forget kind of thing, and we want to get out there and get people excited about
speaking at camp.

So what can you do?

* Prepare a **promo or a lightning talk** at your local meetup.
* **Get in touch with your local community** group and see if anyone would be willing to speak.
* **Recruit folks with awesome stories** to submit CFPs.

We've prepared some [meetup resources on Github](https://github.com/campjs/promo-meetup-resources) to help you get started, but feel free to put your spin on things and let us know if you have ideas for other things we can do.

Our [CFP page](/call-for-papers/) also has a bunch of detail and is a great resource to link people to. Likewise, if there's anything missing or could be improved, please get in touch or [submit a pr](https://github.com/campjs/campjs-ix/blob/master/source/call-for-papers/index.md).

## Finding volunteers
CampJS doesn't make a massive profit (and when it does it goes back into the camp), so we depend on volunteers to help us make it work. At the moment we're not going out of our way to find volunteers, but the info on the [Organisers](/organisers/) page links to the volunteer form.

At a high level we're looking for:

* Folks to help out on the weekend, including: people to enforce the code of conduct, and sober folks with vehicles just in case something goes wrong.
* People to run non-tech activities that non-tech folk (kids, partners, everyone) can enjoy.

If you know anyone who would be keen to help, please let them know about the organizers page and optionally get in touch with one of the organizers to follow it up.

## Promoting the camp
At the moment we're focusing on the CFP process, but will update this when the time comes.

## General social media
Our only active social media presence is [@campjs on Twitter](http://mobile.twitter.com/campjs) at the moment. Tweet us some love and you're almost certainly guaranteed a retweet.

We'd really appreciate:

* tweets about what you're doing to help organize CampJS (finding speakers/preparing for camp etc)
* sharing fun memories of camps gone by
* other thoughts and musings about CampJS and what it means to you

We've already had a few really nice testimonials come in, so if we get enough of these we may compile them into a blog post to help make people feel welcome.

## Thanks!
So thanks so much for helping us make CampJS even more awesome ðŸ˜Š

We know we've got a lot of work ahead of us, and we want to make sure everyone can enjoy the weekend away! If you have any feedback at all, [get in touch with Ash or one of the organizers](/contact), or [submit a PR on this page](https://github.com/campjs/campjs-ix/blob/master/source/organisers/promote/index.md).
