The only thing better than being involved in CampJS as a Camper is being involved as a Sponsor.

We have several Sponsor prospectuses available and would love for you to get in touch with us to craft a package to meet your needs. <a href="mailto:sponsors-team@campjs.com">Request a prospectus</a> and see where you can help out. Any help is appreciated.

Previous sponsors have covered or help paid for:

* Transport (buses)
* Diversity tickets
* Professional photography & video recording
* Food & Drinks
* Coffee
